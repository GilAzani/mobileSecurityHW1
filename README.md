# Mobile Security Homework App

This is a simple Android app that demonstrates several security concepts, including password validation, device state checking, and background service access. The app requires the following conditions to be met in order to allow the user to log in:

* The password input must be equal to the mobile provider of the phone
* The battery level must be above 30%
* Music must be playing in the background
* The phone must be still
* Bluetooth must be active

If all of these conditions are met, a toast message will be displayed indicating that access has been granted.

If any of these conditions are not met, a toast message will be displayed to the user indicating that access has been denied.
